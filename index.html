            <p>Celine Dion was born and raised in Charlemagne, Quebec, Canada. Her birthday is March 30, 1968, and her height is 5'7". Music was important to Dion's family as she was growing up, and she wrote her first song at age 12 with help from her mom and brother Jacques. Her mother sent the song to talent manager and music producer Rene Angelil, who signed her as a client. (The two would go on to marry in 1994.) She released her first French-language debut album, 'La Voix du Bon Dieu,' in 1981; it did not land on the Billboard 200.</p>

            <p>The year 1992 has been recognized as a turning point in Dion's career. Her second English-language album, Celine, sold almost 2,000,000 worldwide and became her first US platinum recording. A single from the album, "If You Asked Me To," reached number one on the Billboard charts. Having become more proficient in English, Dion was able to make a concert tour of Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan. She sang at the Academy Awards (a duet of "Beauty and the Beast," which won for best original song). The recording also won the 1992 Grammy for best pop performance by a duo, cementing Dion's entrance into the US market.</p>
            <p>Dion toured the US, now as headliner, in 1993. In this tour, the trademark methodical control of her image began to be obvious; she designed and directed every element. She performed at such high-profile functions as a command performance for Prince Charles, and the swearing-in of US President Bill Clinton</p>
            <p>By then comfortable conversing in English, Céline Dion hosted the Juno awards broadcast in 1993. She achieved the rare feat of winning Juno awards in both French-language and English-language categories. The same year, she embarked on her first full Canadian tour. Typically over the next several years, her concert tours consisted of sold-out arena or concert hall appearances for several nights at major urban centres. Concerts featured pop material sung in both English and French. Frequent comparisons were made to US "pop divas" Barbra Streisand and Whitney Houston. Dion's repertoire focussed on powerful heart-tugging ballads and dance tunes, selected from songs submitted to her by professional songwriters.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Céline Dion and René Angélil were married; Angélil continued to manage her career. Dion's Colour of My Love album (1993) sold 7 million copies by 1995. "The Power of Love," a single produced by David Foster, reached number one in both Canada and the US, and number four in the United Kingdom. The singer continued to have chart hits in both languages, often in several countries (including France) simultaneously. Her album D'Eux (1995) became the best-selling French album in history; Céline Dion à l'Olympia (1994) made her the world's biggest-selling French-language singer. In the UK, she topped both album and singles charts</p>

            <p>Dion embarked on a period of further intense activity, including world tours (1996-7, 1999) and North American tours (1998). She sang "Power of the Dream" at the opening ceremonies of the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The 1996 album Falling Into You	won Grammy awards for album of the year and best pop album. In 1998 she again appeared on the Academy Awards, singing "My Heart Will Go On," from the film Titanic. This single once more secured for Dion the adulation of teen as well as adult markets.</p>
